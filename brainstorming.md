App ideas- brainstorming

1. Workout app
   - A custom workout tracker app
   - There is a database of exercises. You can choose one and edit the number of sets/reps.
          - You can slide a bar to indicate the intensity you performed the exercise with
          - You can signal on a diagram where you feel pain when you do the exercise
          - You can add some notes as well
   - Simple and easy to use, I want it to be very minimal
2. Wardrobe app
   - I find it hard to remember what is in my wardrobe these days. WIth so many clothes and so many drawers to store them in I lose track of what
     clothes I have. Many of my clothes are forgotten not necessarily because I don't like wearing them anymore, but because they are not on top of
     the pile and I don't remember them.
   - Another problem that I face is when putting together outfits. It is hard to keep track of all my clothes and therefore I stick to a couple 
     articles of clothing and don't wear the rest regularly. I think being able to see the entirety of my wardrobe could solve this problem.
   - For this app, you can take a picture of your clothes, and add tags like 'pant', 'blue', 'leather' so you can search for the piece later on.
   - You can plan your outfit without reaching for your wardrobe
   - I think the app could also have a social media aspect where you can have a profile where you can show off your styles and new clothes/shoes. You
     can have some of your clothes/shoes public and the rest private
   - I think the app will be used by fashion influencers and their followers who would like to have a peek into the persons wardrobe/style
3. Music app
   - Local music app for fun sounds nice- a small cute music playback app
   - An music app game where the app prompts you with a lyric and you guess whether it is from a real song or not. If the lyric exists a short snippet      of the song will play. In collaboration with chatGPT
   - Third idea is an app where you can note the albums/songs you have listened to. Since it easy to forget, you can go through the list. Each element
     will use an API call to present info like album cover, spotify/YT music link, and a summary of the album 
4. House automatication app
   - Sounds cool, but no idea how to build it
5. Morning journal app
   - Asks a couple of prompts every morning automatically as you open the app
   - To set the tone of the day
   - Instead of picking up the phone to check social media, the user can use the app
   - A problem is that the app is encouraging users to use phone in the morning as soon as they wake up
   - Two page app max
   - Has a comforting color theme
   - Sort of like a friend or reflection of your of mind
   - Will say good morning or something like that when you open the app
6. An app where you can note down the movies and shows you have watched, maybe even albums
   - You can choose a streaming platform or not and then add it to your list
  
Top three

1. Wardrobe social media app
- Mobile: The social media aspect of it is uniquely mobile as with other social media platforms like Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. The app will also be 
  accessing the users camera and photo album. This is so that the user can uploasd pictures of their clothes to the app. It would also likely use
  location. 
- Story: I think the value for the audience is clear. Fashion, particularly fast fashion and trends are taking over the world. Fashionistas closely
  follow celebrities to get in on fashion trends before they become big or go out of style. So I think the story is clear and will be recognized by
  users. Like other social media apps, this app will be a way for users to express themselves online and interact/get a peek into the life of their
  friends/celebrities
- Market: The audience for the app is clear. The app is targeted towards celebrities/influencers who are either famous or are in fashion; the app will
  attract users who enjoy fashion/fashion trends and want to take a look into the wardrobe of celebrities that they like/follow on other social media
  platforms
- Habit: Like any other social media app, this one will easily promote habit formation among users. As users want to keep up to date with fashion
  trends they will keep returning to the app and check out their feed and the posts made by influencers they follow. The nature of the app will be
  addicitve and will bring back users because fashion trends keep changing across seasons and across months. 
- Scope: I think the idea is clearly defined, but a full-fledged app will contain many moving parts and aspects that hasn't been figured out yet. I
  am not sure whether a stripped-down version of the app will be that attractive, but it will certainly be interesting to build. i think the scope of
  the app could go further than the requirements of the 101 course- basically there is enough scope for a challenging app to be made.
  
2. Workout exercise tracker
- Mobile: People usually take their phones to the gym. This is where the app will come into use. Therefore, the experience of using this app is
  uniquely mobile. The user will probably be in the gym listening to music playing from their phone. they can switch apps every once in a while to
  update the exercise/number of sets/number of reps/any notes about their set. 
- Story: The audience is clear. The audience isn't particularly niche as they target all gym goers. However, the idea of the app targets a very
  specific audience who are particular in tracking their workout progress and splits. The story of the app is also deliverable and easy to convey in
  a sentence: a workout tracker app to follow your progress and achieve your fitness goals
- Market: The market for the app is large and will attract a niche user base from the gym/workout community. 
- Habit: Working out is a habit. Since the app is a complement to this activity the app will definitely cultivate a habit and repetition among users.
  The user will use the app every time they go to the gym or workout basically. 
- Scope: There is a lot of scope in the app. For starters I will be using everything from a custom tableview, calendar view, navigation to each
  workout and all types of UI elements. There is scope to create the app with just the basic functionality and also if I can to implement more
  advanced features and challenge myself
  
**Final idea: Workout Tracker App!**
